Welcome to the repo for https://bibliotecha.digital/ a personal library manager that started off as a custom project for a for a friend of mine to manage his haphazard book collection, and morphed into a full web app that allows any user to sign up and utilize.

The main idea behind the app is to use your phone's built in camera to scan barcodes to quickly look up books and add to your personal collection. From here, you can track what you have, lend out books to friends quickly, even add notes about the entries in your collection.

I also added other ways to add entries, as well as custom entries that you can even take a custom pic of and upload, all by request of my friend and primary client.

I could bore you with more technical details, but if you've come this far I just recommend visiting the site and giving it a shot!
